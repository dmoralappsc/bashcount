The bashcount.sh is used to output to the Linux terminal a number count in sequential order based on the specified range. The count is written with the range 1-50. The range can be changed accordingly. 

To change the count, modify line 3 (for i in {1..50}) with the desired range. 
  - Change 1 to the starting number and 50 to the final number in the desired count.

Use the following command to run the script from a Linux terminal: ./bashcount.sh

*Ensure the script is executable*

Use the following to ensure the script is executable: chmod +x bashcount.sh
